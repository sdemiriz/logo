# The "what"
After designing the logo by hand, I was frustrated about how I could not manage it programmatically without going
into the `.svg` file and changing values manually one at a time which, if you have worked with the format before,
is tedious and not at all engaging.

So I took it upon myself to replicate the design I came up with by hand using a programming language and some
`.svg` manipulation library. For this I chose Python and its publicly available `drawsvg` package.

# The "how"
Currently there are a number of source code files that work together to generate the "S". The breakdown is as 
follows:

- The `logo.py` script is the launch script which invokes the class from...
- The `centered_logo.py` script which uses...
- The `centered_logo.yaml` configuration file to color and size the logo using...
- The `curve.py` script that contains the logic to make the curves of the logo using its own class.

The logo has an origin coordinate, from where the 
["major" and "minor" grooves](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/MGA2_02-07.html), extended to Bezier curves, start
out from. Using configuration values the heights, widths, colors and even the curvatures of each part
can be adjusted. It is all parametrized and as long as the goal is to create a centered logo design on a 
flat background, all can be done through simply modifying the configuration file.

The configuration file contains a list of entries, which means that by duplicating and changing up the 
parameters specified one can produce multiple logos without interfering with previous versions, allowing 
for quick and effortless prototyping and comparisons.

# How to use:
Clone repository, `cd` to the cloned directory, create the `conda` environment or simply install the 
required dependencies manually, activate the environment if working with `conda` then run the `logo.py` script.
```
git clone https://github.com/sdemiriz/logo.git
cd logo/
conda env create -n sdemiriz-logo --file environment -d
conda activate sdemiriz-logo
python logo.py
```

# How to modify `centered_logo.yaml`
Copy the first `logo1` segment in its entirety and paste it into the same file as a second entry. Adjust
curve parameters, colors, scaling. Adjust image dimensions and filename. Turn on the debug flag to visualize 
Bezier curve handle positions and first curves generated by the script (which are then duplicated for thickness).

No editing on the part of the source code is required if the desire is to generate a centered logo on a plain
background.
